# Industry Standards
A repository for maintaining OpenAPI & AsyncAPI artifacts industry standards, including Spectral rules, and standalone JSON Schema to help automate governance for each standard within any enterprise organization.

# Goals
The goal of this ongoing work is to publish and maintain the following artifacts for each standard here in individul folders.

- **AsyncAPI 2.6** - Maintain an valid AsyncAPI for each version of standard when possible.
- **OpenAPI 3.1** - Maintain an valid OpenAPI for each version of standard when possible.
- **JSON Schema** - Maintain standalone JSON Schema and reference in OAS or AsyncAPI definition.
- **Spectral Ruleset** - Generate rules when possible as well as manually publish Spectral rules.

Feel free to submit PR and issues to suggest new standards or expand on the goals of the project, introducing additional industries into the mix. Not all of the standards have official OpenAPI or AsyncAPI, but the goal of the work might include producing and maintaining a definition until the standards body supports it as part of their own governance process.
