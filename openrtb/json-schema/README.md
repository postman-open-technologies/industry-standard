# JSON Schema

A protobuf definition (for a version of the specification) can be found [here](https://github.com/IABTechLab/openrtb-proto-v2/blob/master/openrtb-core/src/main/protobuf/openrtb.proto).

A port of some of this protobuf can be found in bits and pieces publicly.
One such example exists [here](https://github.com/kubient/openRTB-JSON-Schema/blob/00ceeb35b6106e3ff8b3fd2209291077c3f4864f/Request/request-schema.json) (though it does not appear licensed, so it is not copied into this repository).
