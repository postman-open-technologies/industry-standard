# JSON Schema
All of the JSON Schema files.

The prebid specification is partially dynamic -- in the sense that the JSON Schemas themselves are sent within requests and used for validation by the intermediary.

An example concrete schema for a popular participant can be found [here for AppNexus](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/bidders/appnexus.html).
